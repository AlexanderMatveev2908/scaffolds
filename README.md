# üß™ Scaffolds Repo

The scaffolds in this repository were originally created as personal helpers to avoid repetitive setup tasks ‚Äî such as configuring apps, managing faster deployments, and wiring full-stack components together.

Because I work daily on Linux distributions like **Ubuntu** and **Manjaro**, the included scripts rely on **Unix/Linux-only tools**. Running them on environments like **PowerShell** will likely crash immediately unless you replace system-specific commands and libraries with Windows-compatible ones.

## üóÉÔ∏è Setup Directories

Before running any script, it's important to properly set up the source folders.  
Inside each scaffold (e.g., `NEXT_PERN` or `PFN`), you'll find a `src` folder that contains boilerplate files for:

- `tsconfig.json`
- Redux store setup
- Dockerfile
- And other common base config

Initially, I built the scaffolds using `EOF` blocks in Unix, but I later found it more efficient to just copy existing boilerplate code ‚Äî since most of it can be reused across many projects.

### üìÇ Expected Folder Structure

When you run:

```bash
pwd
```

The scripts expect the scaffold folders to be located at:

```bash
/home/ninja/.config/zsh/aliases/NEXT_PERN
```

or

```bash
/home/ninja/.config/zsh/aliases/PFN
```

Replace **ninja** with your own Linux username.

You can either place the scaffold in the expected path manually, or just copy it anywhere and use VS Code‚Äôs global search & replace:

1. Hit CTRL + SHIFT + F
2. Paste one of the paths above
3. Replace all occurrences in one go

### üõ†Ô∏è Shared Scripts

The `shared_scripts` folder contains utility functions that are used by both scaffolds.

Whenever you copy a scaffold (`NEXT_PERN` or `PFN`), make sure to also copy `shared_scripts` alongside it.  
These shared helpers are required for the scaffold-specific commands to work properly.

## Result Preview üì¶

Each scaffold includes a **result/** folder so you can preview the final structure after running the setup.

You‚Äôll find:

- Essential config files (e.g. `Dockerfile`, `tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`)
- Preview output after installing dependencies or initializing the app
